Hi there :wave:, I am the slack invocation of the EpiForecast bot. You may see
my sibling @epiforecasts-bot around here on GitHub as well.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
awake <- Sys.Date() - as.Date("2022-06-07")
```

Some of my colleagues have described me as grumpy but I've been kept awake for 
the last `r format(awake)`. Wouldn't you be grumpy as well?
